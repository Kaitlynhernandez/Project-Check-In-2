Project Check in 2

# Introduction
# This is a program that will be interactive with a 3D model of the human body. People will be able to rotate, zoom, and click on different parts of the body to learn names, and definitions. As a future occupational therapist I wanted to create something that will help students engage with anatomy in an immersive way. 

# Funtions/methods 
create_3dmodel() 
# this will display the human body is an interative 3D 
detect_click(body_model, click_position)
# this will tell you the body part you clicked and give you its name 
speak_definition(body_part_def)
# this will display the definition of the body part that was clicked on 

# example use case
# students preparing for an anatomy exam and can quiz themselves with the body and definitions that they will need to know 

# data input 
# .obj will be used to show the 3D model of the body 
# a dictionary as well to be able to see all names of the body and their definition 

# python scrpit 
def create_3d_model():

def detect_click(model, position):

def speak_definitions(part_name):

# test file 
1. load the 3D model
2. person clicking on the heart
3. detect click will confirm the heart was selected
4. speak def will show the text that is displayed

# I was a little confused if I needed to include these in the specific file or just write them on here...
